## Resume Description Template

```
TDRF - Threat Detection & Response Framework
Python | Cybersecurity | Network Security
GitHub: github.com/tbhuiyan625/TDRF

• Developed comprehensive Python security framework with real-time 
  threat detection, multi-threaded port scanning (100+ concurrent 
  threads), and automated security reporting

• Implemented Windows Event Log analysis engine using pywin32 API 
  to detect brute force attacks and suspicious login patterns with 
  configurable threshold-based detection

• Built modular architecture with 8 core components including log 
  analyzers, network scanners, event correlators, and report 
  generators supporting HTML/PDF/JSON output formats

• Created dual interface (CLI and GUI) using tkinter for different 
  use cases, demonstrating versatility in UI/UX design

• Integrated pattern matching algorithms and statistical analysis 
  for anomaly detection and threat severity classification

Technologies: Python 3.8+, pywin32, socket programming, threading,
tkinter, regular expressions, Windows API, network protocols
```

## For Interviews

### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: Why did you build this?**
> "I wanted to demonstrate my understanding of cybersecurity principles and Python programming by building a practical tool that security professionals would actually use. It showcases my ability to work with system APIs, network protocols, and design modular software."

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
> "Implementing efficient multi-threaded port scanning while avoiding false positives and handling various network conditions. I solved this using thread pools and proper timeout handling."

**Q: How would you improve it?**
> "Add machine learning for anomaly detection, integrate with SIEM platforms via REST API, containerize with Docker, and add distributed scanning capabilities for enterprise environments."

**Q: Can you walk me through the architecture?**
> "Sure! It follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns. The core has analyzers for log processing, scanners for network recon, a correlation engine for pattern matching, and reporting modules for output. Each component is independent and can be extended easily."
